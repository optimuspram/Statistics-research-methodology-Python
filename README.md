# Statistics-research-methodology-Python
This is a Python repository used as a teaching material for the "Research Methodology" course taught at Institut Teknologi Bandung. There are three main subtopics taught in this course:

* Descriptive statistics and data visualization
* Basics of hypothesis test
* Regression (linear regression and polynomial regression)

All topics are accompanied by Jupyter notebooks and codes. Students will find the codes useful to enhance their understanding on the topics. The codes here are just a starting point for the students, which is why I highly recommend the students 
to explore other Python codes or packages.
